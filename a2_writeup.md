# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
I think figuring out the right kind of loop (if, while, elif, etc.) was definitely challenging, and also figuring out how/when to loop them was also kind of challenging to me. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could use the match function by taking a key word (ex: "movie" or "year", etc.) and group the data in the database based on what keyword it matches(make dict(s)?), then print out what the user asks for based on what keywords they use.
